# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This game is a fun implementation inspired by the classic snake game, created as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge on Udemy.

## Overview

This project leverages Python's object-oriented programming features, such as classes, inheritance, slicing, and the turtle module, providing an engaging way to reinforce these concepts through the creation of an interactive game.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yingliu1206/SnakeGame.git
   cd SnakeGame

2. **Run the game**: Ensure you have Python installed, then run
   ```bash
   python main.py

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Try to eat the food to grow your snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
